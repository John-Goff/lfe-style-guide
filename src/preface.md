# Preface

The LFE Style Guide takes inspirection (and often times actual content) directly from key sources in the Lisp, Erlang, and even Clojure developer communities. These are as follows

* [Google Common Lisp Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/lispguide.xml)
* [A Guide to Writing Good, Maintainable Common Lisp Code](https://lisp-lang.org/style-guide/)
* [Tutorial on Good Lisp Programming Style](http://norvig.com/luv-slides.ps)
* [Erlang Programming Rules and Conventions](http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml)
* [Erlang Coding Standards & Guidelines](https://github.com/inaka/erlang_guidelines)
* [The Clojure Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide)
* [How to ns](https://stuartsierra.com/2016/clojure-how-to-ns.html)

Note, however, that these are not considered sacrosanct sources of ultimate truth; (and neither is this guide). Instead, they contain practices that we have either adopted as-is, modified to some extent, or simply rejected (e.g., due to prior conventions established in MACLISP and LMI Lisp, their inapploicabliity due to LFE's unique status as a Lisp _and_ Erlang dialect, etc.).

In geneeral we suggest following the LFE style as outlined here if you are creating a new project. If you are contributing to a project maintained by someonoe in the community, we recommend consistency: using the style adopted by _that_ project (for any contributions to that project).

Above all, enjoy the parenthesis.
